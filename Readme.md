A collection of cyber security scripts.

CPVII Scripts
Please note there's conflicting rules about scripts. I'm not liable if you read the rulebook, make any assertions on your own, use them and get disqualified. The rule is potentially going to clarified/rewritten by the next competition period anyway so it's a non-argument.

Turns off Remote Desktop Connections at multiple levels,
